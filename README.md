# DECO3801
DECO3801 2020 Sem 2 Assignment

## Project Details
This is a Flutter web application, with the primary function of serving the user interaction page. The web API for the yield prediction site of the project (a separate project built with ASP.NET) can be found at https://github.com/Conman-123/DECO3801

## Development Environment
Android Studio or Visual Studio Code is needed to debug and run the code. Flutter and Dart plugin will have to be installed on the IDE. Flutter SDK also have to be installed on the system.
To setup a Flutter environment, please refer to this documentation https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Upon opening the project for the first time, all the required dependencies need to be downloaded. To do this, open **pubspec.yaml** and select _get dependencies_. The equivalent command line for this is **flutter pub get**.

To run a Flutter web application, the Flutter web configuration need to be set as enabled. To do this, run the command **flutter config --enable-web** on the terminal. Once it is set, the IDE needs to be restarted in order for the change to take effect.
When reopening the project, you should be able to see Chrome/Edge as the available browsers to run the code. Choose one browser and press the green play button to run the code.
